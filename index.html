			<P> My name is Mohammad Abdullah; some people call me Mo. I grew up in
		Mishref, Kuwait amid an education-oriented environment and decided later to
		pursue a career in physics. I earned a Bachelors degree in Physics with a minor
		in Mathematics from Kuwait University in 2010. I was then awarded the Kuwait
		University Scholarship to pursue a PhD in theoretical particle physics at the
		University of California, Irvine. I graduated in 2017 and took on a three-years
		postdoc term at the Mitchell Institute of Fundamental Physics and Astronomy,
		Texas A&M University. </P>

			 My research focus is phenomenology beyond the standard model. Phenomenology is the study of particle physics phenomena, the ultimate goal being to understand the fundamental building blocks of nature and how they interact with one another. Over the past century or so physicists have constructed an elegant model that can, in principle, explain most of what we observe. This is known as the Standard Model of particle physics. We know, however, that it is not complete and there are several unsolved puzzles that we need to address. To that end, theorists (such as myself) work hand-in-hand with experimentalists to look for new physics. In other words we look for physics beyond the standard model.

			 I have
		 previously worked on supersymmetry, dark matter, and their overlap, but most
		 recently I have been more interested in neutrino physics. In particular, I
		 would like to investigate what we could learn from Coherent Elastic
		 Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering, or CE<i>v</i>NS (commonly pronounced "Sevens"). I
		 have also collaborated with experimentalists from ATLAS and CMS in sensitivity
		 studies for resonance searches at the LHC. <br> <br> You can view my

			My friends introduced me to rock climbing when I moved to South California and I found, for the first time, a sport that I enjoy enough to pursue. It can be practiced in a fairly static fashion and offers a pleasureful mix of body tension, problem solving, challenge, and an occasional adrenaline rush. That's just climbing indoors. Outdoor rock climbing, in addition, grants you singular perspectives of the surrounding landscape. 

Rock climbing also motivated me to incorporate fitness into my life style in the form of running, resistance training and yoga. All of that, along with the ever so friendly climbing community, have had a positive impact on my mental health in a period when I desperately needed it.

			I've had an interest in western music for as long as I can recall, and the interest flared into obsession during highschool. In 2004, with some peer influence, I asked my older sister to teach me how to read a piano score and started practicing on her then-9-years-old Yamaha studio piano. I started off with the usual repertoire of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, but I didn’t follow through that route. I ventured instead into imrov’, and today I belong to the rare species of classical improvisors. Most of my music falls either into the baroque, classic, or romantic eras, although I do dabble with jazz, modern, and new age music from time to time.

			My approach to piano doesn’t lend itself to ensemble music, so I decided to get into choral singing.

I sang baritone with a men’s chorus in California for one year which was mostly pop music plus some Christmas music. We also got to perform a cover for a well attended concert at the Hollywood Bowl which was quite the memorable experience.

While in College Station I joined the Brazos Valley Chorale which is more to my element when it comes to musical style. Most notably, I got to perform the Mozart Requiem and Orff’s Carmina Burana accompanied with the Brazos Valley Symphony Orchestra. I am technically already a member of the Ahmadi Music Group Chorus in Kuwait but I am yet to even rehearse with them because of the pandemic.

			Music Composition
				</DIV>
			
			<DIV STYLE="margin-bottom:50px"><P><P>
			If you are writing music for someone else to perform, say an ensemble or an orchestra, you have to produce a score, which could be quite laborious and technically involved. But if you are singlehandedly producing the music, as do many indie video game composers, you needn't even a clue how sheet music works. All you need is a capable computer and a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). The DAW lets you mix and edit audio tracks, and provides a library of samples which you can think of as virtual instruments. With enough experience you can generate stunning results using freely available software.
			
			I was inspired to try out composition by a Twitter group called the Music Weeklies Challenge: you are given a theme every week and tasked to compose original music around that theme. I've submitted a few entries in various genres, some of which received rather favorable feedback.

			I have always struggled with the mechanics of drawing; my hands are unsteady  and my sense of proportions is dreadful. Digital art software drastically mitigate, if not completely bypass, these issues so I can focus on the ideas, on how simple combinations of shapes and colors can be assigned physical interpretations by our brains. With the performance and features of modern software and hardware, and the plethora of online tutorials, art has never been so accesible for the beginner.
			
			I'm currently using the ProCreate app on an iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil 2. I alternate between abstract automatic drawings and cartoonish art, and occasionally make an attempt at a detailed landscape tutorial.
